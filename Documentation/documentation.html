                    <h1>Documentation</h1>
		
                    <p>ClanLib is a cross platform toolkit library with a primary focus on game creation. The
                    library is Open Source and free for commercial use, under the <a href="license.html">ClanLib License</a>.</p>
		
                    <p>The library is split into a number of sub-libraries, each providing different classes
                    of functionality. The library is deliberately built so that the different parts try not
                    to put more external dependencies than they absolutely have to. With the exception of
                    clanCore, you can pretty much cherry pick which libraries and classes you find useful,
                    and avoid using the rest. Because of this, you can easily use ClanLib for non-gaming purposes,
                    or mix ClanLib classes with other libraries without getting forced a load of things upon you
                    that you do not need.</p>
		
                    <h2>Getting started with the build environment</h2>
		
                    <p>The first step is to ensure that your build environment is set up and ready. We have
                    the following guides to help you with this:</p>
		
                    <ul>
	                    <li><a href="build-environment-windows-msvc.html">Visual C++ on Windows</a></li>
	                    <li><a href="build-environment-linux-gcc.html">GNU C++ on Linux systems</a></li>
                    </ul>
		
                    <p>After you have set up your build environment and successfully built ClanLib, you are ready
                    to start creating your applications.</p>
		
                    <h2>Creating your applications</h2>
		
                    <p>ClanLib supports that you use the normal platform specific main functions, such as main or
                    WinMain, but a more common approach is to use the cross platform application main provided by
                    the clanApplication library. We have a few examples here on how simple "Hello World" ClanLib
                    applications may look like:</p>
		
                    <ul>
	                    <li><a href="example-console.html">Console "Hello World" example</a></li>
	                    <li><a href="example-display.html">Display "Hello World" example</a></li>
                    </ul>
		
                    <p>In general, ClanLib is used by simply constructing the objects you require. The only
                    prerequisites is that for each ClanLib sub-library you need to first construct a SetupXX
                    object which performs any initializations and deinitializations required for the library.</p>
		
                    <h2>Getting help</h2>
		
                    <p>If you are having any problems with ClanLib or find some documentation to be limited about
                    a certain topic you can always ask in our forums. These documents might help you as well:</p>
